## Detailed Work Experience

#### Thermo Fisher Scientific – Senior Embedded Software Engineer
    Updated 32bit legacy code, untouched for 8 years, to 64bit. Backend is
    written in C++ and the UI in C#. Added support for a new camera and other
    new hardware. A Windows service drives HW and responds to gRPC requests from
    the UI. I also crafted installer, integrating it into our CI\CD pipeline
    utilizing Jenkins, GitLab, NuGet and Thermo Fisher’s in–house dependency 
    manager. Added error propagation over gRPC from the service to the UI.

#### Intel Corporation – Senior Software Engineer
    Worked on multiple versions of client–side update application (Python\C++).
    Developed features and bug fixes for a headless SDK model of the update
    service for Windows. Scrum Master and contributor for effort to port the SDK
    to work on both Windows and Ubuntu from a single codebase managed in Git.
    Efforts included reworking the build system, unit tests, and acceptance
    tests to function correctly on both OSes.

    Led our team in developing a proof–of–concept IoT manageability application.
    We delivered high quality demo code with a feature set exceeding original
    expectations, despite resource constraints, tight schedule, and logistical
    challenges. After the demo, we extended the reach of our solution by making
    it a cross–platform (Linux/Windows/OS X), set of micro–services and clients
    in C++ cross–complied using CMAKE.

    Platform level SOC debug and validation for Over Clocking, Power Management,
    and Type–C Subsystem for Intel’s workstation platforms (Server CPU paired
    with Consumer PCH). Utilized WinDbg, Intel IPT eXtended Debug Port, power
    meters, and my own code to characterize and debug SOC platform and Windows
    behavior with each prerelease combination of firmware\OS\drivers (created
    every two weeks). Coordinated work of US contractors reporting to Bangalore
    based manager and company.

    Worked on a wide variety of technologies implementing features and bug fixes
    for the Context SDK. Highly agile environment with multiple disparate
    customers and priorities. We provided the SDK in Swift, NodeJS, C#, Java,
    and Go. Led the development of the Swift version of the Context SDK that
    works for both iOS and macOS. Mentored new team members when team doubled in
    size, training them on Git/GitLab, the build system, our microservices
    architecture, and our development environment.

    Spearheaded effort to develop Planning Systems & Software for manufacturing
    capacity planning needs. Systems were built using SQL Server Data Tools, C#,
    and related technologies. When budget and schedule constraints arose, I
    rearchitected both frontend and backend solutions to allow a six–month
    project to be completed in 3 months with just 2 developers instead of 5.

#### Harmonic Inc. – Senior Software Development Engineer
    Wrote C++ embedded applications, drivers, diagnostics, and environmental
    controls (thermal management) for video servers running Linux. Worked with
    Hardware/FPGA Team to bring up new board with custom FPGA. Wrote combined
    Linux Kernel Drivers for an I2C and SPI bus sharing a common PCIe memory
    mapped register. Architected and implemented embedded C++ microservice for
    environmental control. The microservice had to use readings from various
    embedded sensors on the backplane board and on two separate hot swappable
    units each with independent CPUs in a 1 RU chassis. Wrote several diagnostic
    tests for Manufacturing to use from testing the I2C buses and various
    devices such as power supplies, NVRAM components, and temperature sensors
    scattered across the various I2C buses of the 3 boards.

#### Cognex – Principal Software Engineer & Senior Software Engineer
    Wafer ID: Program Manager and key contributor for firmware(C++) and UI(C#)
    of 1740 Series products. Firmware and GUI development of numerous product
    enhancements through multiple release cycles. Developed firmware solution to
    automatically select the best settings for lighting, character size, and
    dynamically applying image processing algorithms for optimal OCR accuracy.
    Improved ID reading algorithm to simultaneously check for black–on–white
    and white–on–black characters with zero increase in processing time.

    Track and Trace: Firmware and Windows application development of Audit
    logging system. Developed a .NET TCP/IP messaging system in C++/C# to log
    settings changes made to embedded camera. Architected a messaging protocol,
    implemented queued TCP/IP messaging in the firmware (C++), developed a 
    Windows service(C#) to receive the messages, created a GUI to manage this
    service, and provided an API for customers that allowed them to easily
    integrate the data with their manufacturing systems.

#### Tektronix Software Design Engineer III, II, and I
    Technical Lead for small software team building cross process memory manager
    for C++/C# applications. Software utilized remote procedure calls to 
    coordinate data creation and utilization between Windows .NET applications
    without the need for a centralized service.

    Wrote embedded C/C++ software for oscilloscopes using VxWorks and Windows.
    Designed and implemented embedded software for 3 generations of display
    hardware embedded in a custom ASIC. Collaborated with hardware engineers in
    turning on and debugging chips/boards. Leveraged multiple custom ASICs to
    draw a single coherent display, increasing display frame rates 10X. Created
    reusable display software utilized on multiple models of oscilloscopes, each
    with varying numbers of ASICs. Also designed, implemented, and maintained
    automated CI\CD system for nightly and on demand software builds.

    Designed and implemented MultiView Zoom™ feature of Tektronix Oscilloscopes.
